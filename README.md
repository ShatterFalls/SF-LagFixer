# [​SF] LagFixer v1.1.1

[ShatterFalls] LagFixer is a datapack designed to do exactly what its name implies - fix lag. Developed from scratch by the team at [ShatterFalls], this pack is specifically created to reduce server-wide lag and stutter. LagFixer is able to target and remove the root causes of lag, providing a smoother and more enjoyable gameplay experience for all players. Additionally, we are constantly seeking feedback and suggestions from our community to improve and enhance the functionality of LagFixer. So if you’re tired of dealing with frustrating lag and stutter, give [ShatterFalls] LagFixer a try!

## What does it do?
Minecraft stores item data in a unique way that can eventually build up and create lag. Many of us may have noticed that over time, our worlds - whether on a client or server - start to slow down in places with mob farms, large builds, lots of redstone, etc. This datapack aims to clear the lag by removing unused or unnecessary entities and items.

## What does it remove?
By default, LagFixer will typically remove items not on the internal blacklist and entities that cannot be interacted with by the player, only targeting what can build up and cause lag. By changing the built-in settings, LagFixer can remove much more than just unnecessary items, including minecarts, ender pearls, armor stands, tridents, and more!

## Will my important items be cleared?
LagFixer has a built-in blacklist for items that should never be cleared. This includes diamond armor/tools, netherite armor/tools, shulkers, golden foods, mob heads, etc. You’ll never have to worry about your items being cleared again!

## Why is this needed?
Minecraft takes too long to remove items and entities on its own, often allowing thousands of items or entities to be loaded, with a good chunk of them being completely unnecessary. LagFixer steps in by giving the player control over when and what Minecraft should clear.
