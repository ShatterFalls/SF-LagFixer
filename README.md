# [SF] LagFixer v1

[ShatterFalls] LagFixer intends to do just as it's name implies, Fix Lag. Built from the ground up by the team at [[ShatterFalls]](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/shatterfalls/), this pack should aid in reducing Server wide lag and Stutter.
Designed with heavy inpiration from [AntrolGaming's](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/antrolgaming/) [LagClear](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/eng-ver-lagclear/) and [TomatoCake's](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/tomatocake/) [ClearLag](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/clearlag-v2/), bringing the best qualities from each into a singular pack while adding some extra quality of life features unique to LagFixer.

## What does it do?

Minecraft stores data of items in a unique way that will eventually build up and create "Lag". Many of us may have noticed that over time our worlds, client or server, will start to slow down in places with mob farms, large builds, lots of redstone, etc. This datapack aims to clear the lag by removing unused or unnecessary entities and items.

## What does it remove?

By default LagFixer will typically remove items not on the internal blacklist, and entities that can not be interacted with by the player only going for what can build up can cause lag. By changing the built in settings, LagFixer can remove lots more than just unnecessary items including Minecarts, Ender Pearls, Armor Stands, Tridents, and more!

## Will my important items be cleared?

LagFixer has a built in blacklist for items that should never be cleared. this includes Diamond Armor/Tools, Netherite Armor/Tools, Shulkers, Golden Foods, Mob Heads, etc. Never worry about your items being cleared again!

## Why is this needed?

Minecraft takes too long to remove items and entities on its own, often times allowing thousands of items or entities to be loading with good chunk being completely unneeded. LagFixer steps in by giving the Player control over when and what Minecraft should clear.
